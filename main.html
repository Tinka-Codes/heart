        <h1>I’m Sorry</h1>

        <p>
          First of all i would like to say sorry for what i said yesterday, I
          was hurt and spoke from that place. You didn’t deserve that. And i was
          scared to come apologize to you so i made this hoping it will make you
          feel all nice inside. Not really but whatever.

        <h1>How I Felt</h1>

        <p>
          When you didn’t text for a whole day, I felt forgotten. I didn’t know
          what was going on, and it hurt. More than you know. And got more upset
          when you didn't say anything about it.

        <h1>The Truth</h1>

        <p>
          These past weeks, I started liking you more than I expected. I know
          you might not feel the same, because of how you dragged it and
          ignoring some of the things i said. It hurt a bit but there's nothing
          i can do about it. And im slowly coming to terms with the fact that
          "hy Dexter might not like you romantically"
